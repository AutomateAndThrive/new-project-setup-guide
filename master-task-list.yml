# ==============================================================================
# Initial Project Setup Issues
#
# Purpose:
#   This file contains the master list of tasks required to transition the
#   repository from a basic skeleton to a fully documented and bootstrapped
#   project, ready for feature development.
#
# Usage:
#   This YAML file is designed to be parsed by an automation script
#   (e.g., create_github_issues.py) to programmatically
#   create issues in the project's issue tracker.
