# **Initial Project Creator's Guide**

### **Audience and Purpose**

This document is intended exclusively for the **Initial Project Creator** (e.g., the project lead or founding developer). Its sole purpose is to serve as the official record and explanation for the **one-time-only process** of creating this monorepo from an empty directory.

**All subsequent developers** joining the project should disregard this guide and refer to the New Developer Onboarding Guide for setup instructions.

### **Recommended Setup Method: Automation Script**

For the initial creation of the repository, the use of the init\_project.sh automation script is the prescribed and most efficient method. This script is designed to execute all the necessary setup procedures in a single operation, ensuring consistency and eliminating the potential for manual error.

The subsequent sections of this guide serve as a detailed, step-by-step documentation of the procedures performed by the automation script. They provide a comprehensive record of the repository's foundational structure and configuration principles.

### **Section I: Project Initialization and Version Control Configuration**

The inaugural procedure is the establishment of the principal project directory upon the local file system. Subsequently, this directory must be initialized as a Git version control repository to track all modifications.

\# Creation of the root project directory.  
mkdir pod-system-b  
cd pod-system-b

\# Initialization of a new Git repository.  
git init

\# Establishment of the primary branches for the repository.  
\# The 'main' branch is reserved for stable, production-ready releases.  
git branch \-M main  
\# The 'develop' branch will serve as the primary integration branch for development.  
git checkout \-b develop

It is a requirement that following the initial push to the remote repository, the develop branch be designated as the default branch within the remote repository's configuration settings.

### **Section II: Core Directory Structuring**

Following initialization, the requisite top-level sub-directories for the project are created. Subsequently, a detailed internal structure is established for both the backend and frontend applications to provide a standardized foundation for development.

#### **Top-Level Directories**

\# From the root of the 'pod-system-b' directory, the following commands are executed:  
mkdir backend  
mkdir frontend  
mkdir docs

#### **Detailed Application Structure**

The automation script proceeds to create the following comprehensive directory and file structure, including necessary placeholder files to bootstrap development:

pod-system-b/  
├── backend/  
│   ├── app/  
│   │   ├── \_\_init\_\_.py  
│   │   ├── main.py  
│   │   ├── config.py  
│   │   ├── database.py  
│   │   ├── models/  
│   │   │   └── \_\_init\_\_.py  
│   │   ├── routers/  
│   │   │   └── \_\_init\_\_.py  
│   │   └── schemas/  
│   │       └── \_\_init\_\_.py  
│   ├── tests/  
│   │   └── \_\_init\_\_.py  
│   ├── .env.example  
│   └── requirements.txt  
│  
├── frontend/  
│   └── src/  
│       ├── App.jsx  
│       ├── main.jsx  
│       ├── index.css  
│       ├── components/  
│       │   ├── ui/  
│       │   │   └── Button.jsx  
│       │   └── feature-specific/  
│       ├── context/  
│       │   └── AppContext.jsx  
│       ├── hooks/  
│       ├── pages/  
│       │   └── HomePage.jsx  
│       ├── test/  
│       └── utils/  
│  
└── docs/

### **Section III: .gitignore File Configuration**

To maintain repository integrity and exclude extraneous artifacts from version control, the creation of a .gitignore configuration file is mandated. This file delineates file patterns that are to be intentionally excluded from tracking by the Git system. A new file named .gitignore is created in the root directory and populated with the specified content.

### **Section IV: Root README.md File Creation**

The README.md file, situated at the root of the directory structure, functions as the principal portal and summary exposition for the project. A preliminary placeholder file is instituted, with the provision that its contents will be substantially elaborated upon during the inaugural phase of documentation.

### **Section V: Initial Repository Commit**

The foundational project structure, having been established, must now be committed to the repository's history. Adherence to the Conventional Commits specification for the formulation of commit messages is herewith prescribed as a standard of practice.

\# Addition of all newly created files and directories to the Git staging area.  
git add .

\# Creation of the initial commit with a descriptive message.  
git commit \-m "chore: initial project structure and configuration"

### **Section VI: Remote Repository Configuration**

The local repository must be confederated with a remote counterpart. The procedure for this confederation involves creating a new, empty repository on a platform such as GitHub and linking it to the local repository.

\# The placeholder herein must be replaced with the veridical URL of the remote repository.  
git remote add origin https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/pod-system-b.git

\# The 'main' and 'develop' branches are to be pushed to the remote repository.  
git push \-u origin main  
git push \-u origin develop

A final, critical directive: within the configuration settings of the remote GitHub repository, the default branch designation must be altered from 'main' to develop.

### **Section VII: Subsequent Actions**

With the successful completion of the initialization and configuration protocols, the repository is hereby deemed established. The subsequent course of action is to populate the project's issue tracker. Please refer to the **Initial Project Task List** guide for the complete set of tasks and the YAML data required for their automated creation. This will systematically guide the development of the application boilerplate and the completion of all baseline documentation.
