# **New Project Setup Guide**

A comprehensive toolkit for initializing new software projects with professional best practices, automated setup scripts, and complete developer onboarding documentation.

This repository provides everything you need to bootstrap a new project with proper structure, documentation, and workflows - regardless of the project type or technology stack.

## **What This Provides**

- **Automated project initialization** with customizable templates
- **Complete developer onboarding** documentation and workflows
- **Professional project structure** following industry best practices
- **Task management integration** with GitHub Issues
- **Flexible configuration** for any project type

## **What This Does NOT Do**

The automated scripts provide a **foundation and structure**, but they do **NOT** implement your specific business logic or features:

### **‚ùå Not Included**
- **Custom business logic** - You must implement your specific application features
- **Domain-specific database schema** - Only provides basic user table; you add your entities
- **Custom API endpoints** - Provides auth/user routes; you add your business endpoints
- **Frontend UI components** - Provides basic React setup; you build your specific UI
- **External integrations** - No payment processors, third-party APIs, etc.
- **Custom authentication** - Basic user model only; you implement your auth strategy
- **Business rules and validation** - You define your specific validation logic
- **Custom deployment configuration** - Basic Docker setup; you configure for your cloud
- **Domain-specific testing** - Provides test framework; you write your test cases
- **Custom monitoring/logging** - Basic setup only; you add your observability tools

### **‚úÖ What You Get**
- **Production-ready project structure** with best practices
- **Database migrations framework** with initial user table
- **API routing structure** with basic auth/user endpoints
- **Frontend development environment** with hot reloading
- **CI/CD pipeline templates** ready for customization
- **Development tools** (ESLint, Prettier, Husky, etc.)
- **Environment configurations** for dev/staging/production
- **Docker setup** for containerized development
- **Testing framework** ready for your tests
- **Documentation templates** to build upon

## **Quick Start**

1. **Clone this repository** to use as your project setup template
2. **Run `./init_project.sh`** to create your new project structure
3. **Follow the pre-development checklist** to complete setup before development begins

## **Next Steps After Running the Script**

After running `./init_project.sh`, you'll have a complete project foundation. The next phase is **pre-development setup**:

### **üìã Pre-Development Checklist**
Use the `pre-development-checklist.yml` file to track essential setup tasks:

- **Foundation Review & Setup** - Understand the generated structure and configure environment
- **Domain Planning & Database Design** - Define your business entities and create database schema
- **Development Environment Setup** - Configure tools, testing, and development workflows
- **Project Configuration** - Update metadata and configure external services
- **Team Setup & Documentation** - Establish development standards and project management

### **üöÄ Ready for Development**
Once the pre-development checklist is complete, your team can begin:
- Implementing business logic and API endpoints
- Building frontend components and user interfaces
- Writing tests and documentation
- Deploying to production environments
