## **‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)**

### **General Questions**

**Q: What makes this different from other project templates?**
A: This template focuses on **enforcement over complexity**. It automatically prevents technical debt accumulation through pre-commit hooks, enforces code quality standards, and provides comprehensive documentation that actually gets used.

**Q: Is this suitable for large teams?**
A: This template is optimized for **solo developers and small teams** (1-10 developers). For larger teams, you may want to add additional governance and approval workflows.

**Q: Can I customize the tech stack?**
A: Yes! The `init_project.sh` script supports multiple frontend frameworks (React, Vue, Angular, Next.js), backend frameworks (Node.js, Python, .NET, Java), and databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, SQLite).

### **Setup & Configuration**

**Q: How long does initial setup take?**
A: Running `./init_project.sh` takes about 2-3 minutes. Complete setup including environment configuration typically takes 15-30 minutes for a new developer.

**Q: What if I don't want all the enforcement tools?**
A: You can selectively disable tools by modifying the configuration files, but we recommend keeping them as they prevent common issues and maintain code quality.

**Q: How do I update the project template?**
A: Clone this repository, make your customizations, and use it as your new template. The template itself is version controlled and can be updated over time.

### **Development Workflow**

**Q: What happens if I try to commit bad code?**
A: Pre-commit hooks will automatically block the commit and show you what needs to be fixed. This includes linting errors, formatting issues, and failing tests.

**Q: How do I handle hotfixes?**
A: Follow the hotfix workflow in the Project Branching Strategy guide. Create a hotfix branch from main, make your changes, and create a PR that will be fast-tracked.

**Q: What if the CI pipeline fails?**
A: The CI pipeline will show you exactly what failed. Fix the issues locally, push your changes, and the pipeline will re-run automatically.

### **Quality & Standards**

**Q: Why is 80% test coverage required?**
A: 80% coverage provides a good balance between thorough testing and development speed. It catches most bugs while not being overly burdensome.

**Q: How do I add new dependencies?**
A: Use `npm install` as usual. Dependabot will automatically create PRs for security updates, and the CI pipeline will test compatibility.

**Q: What if I need to bypass a pre-commit hook?**
A: Use `git commit --no-verify` (not recommended) or fix the underlying issue. The hooks are there to prevent problems, not create them.

### **Troubleshooting**

**Q: Husky hooks aren't working after cloning**
A: Run `npm install` and then `npm run prepare` to set up the Git hooks properly.

**Q: Tests are failing locally but passing in CI**
A: Check that you're using the same Node.js version and that all dependencies are installed. Run `npm ci` to ensure exact dependency versions.

**Q: TypeScript errors in VS Code but not in terminal**
A: Restart the TypeScript language server in VS Code (Cmd+Shift+P ‚Üí "TypeScript: Restart TS Server").

### **Getting Help**

**Q: Where can I find more detailed documentation?**
A: Check the `docs/` directory for comprehensive guides on development, API documentation, and project management.

**Q: How do I contribute to this template?**
A: Fork the repository, make your improvements, and submit a pull request. We welcome contributions that improve the developer experience.

**Q: What if I find a bug or have a feature request?**
A: Please create an issue on GitHub with a clear description of the problem or feature request.
