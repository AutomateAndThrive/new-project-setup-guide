# ==============================================================================
# Pre-Development Setup Checklist
#
# Purpose:
#   This file contains the essential tasks required to complete the setup
#   after running the scaffolding script, before beginning actual development.
#
# Usage:
#   This YAML file is designed to be parsed by an automation script
#   (e.g., create_github_issues.py) to programmatically
#   create issues in the project's issue tracker.
#
# Customization:
#   Update the project details and add any project-specific setup requirements.
