# Architecture Decision Log

This log tracks all major architectural and technical decisions made in the project. Each entry should reference an ADR or a significant decision, with a summary and status.

   - Status (Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded)
   - Short summary
3. Update the status as the decision progresses.
